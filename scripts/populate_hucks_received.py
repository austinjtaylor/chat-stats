"""
Populate hucks_received in player_game_stats from game_events data.

A huck is defined as a completed pass (PASS or GOAL event) with 40+ vertical yards.
This stat is NOT provided by the UFA API and must be calculated from game event coordinates.

Run this via: uv run python scripts/populate_hucks_received.py
