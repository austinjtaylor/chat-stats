"""
Add composite indexes to improve player stats and team stats query performance.

This script adds critical indexes to optimize the following queries:
- Team stats aggregation (get_comprehensive_team_stats)
- Player stats queries
- Game lookups with team filtering

Run this on your production Supabase database to fix slow team stats page load times.
